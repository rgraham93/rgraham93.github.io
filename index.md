title: About Me

---

I'm a graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point with a major in Web & Digital Media Development and a minor in Computer Information Systems. My professional goal is to make tasks easier for people to accomplish. Working in Quality Assurance, I can accomplish this goal by ensuring that a user is able to complete their tasks as smooth and fast as possible. I'm very laid back and believe that time goes by better when you're doing something you enjoy.
